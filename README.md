# I am Rich!

## What is "I am Rich" app?

The "I am Rich" app is equivalent to the "Hello World" program in most of the languages. On getting started with Dart and Flutter development, this is the tradition that is followed. This app was originally developed by Armin Heinrich in the year 2008 and was distributed using the App Store. When launched, the screen only contained a glowing red gem and an icon that, when pressed, displays the following mantra in large text:
"I am rich
I deserve it
I am good,
healthy & successful"

Eight people bought the application, at least one of whom claimed to have done so accidentally. Six US sales at $999.99 and two European ones for â‚¬799.99 netted $5,600 for developer Armin Heinrich and $2,400 for Apple. In correspondence with the Los Angeles Times, Heinrich told the newspaper that Apple had refunded two purchasers of his app, and that he was happy not to have dissatisfied customers.
The application is described as "a work of art with no hidden function at all", with its only purpose being to show other people that they were able to afford it and  was removed from the App Store without explanation by Apple Inc. the day after its release, August 6, 2008.
